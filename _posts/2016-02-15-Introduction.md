Hey my name is Erick Weigel, a.k.a Stenwulf. I just created this blog on GitHub Pages using Jekyll. If you're reading this trying to figure out how you can get started, go checkout [this tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) I used. A real nice guy named Barry Clark created a prebuilt repository that can be simply forked to get started.

I hope you enjoy reading about some of the stuff I think about and do!
